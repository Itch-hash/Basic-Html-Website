# Basic-Html-Website

This repo was pushed as a project being followed from roadmap.sh

[Roadmap.sh-basic-html-website](https://roadmap.sh/projects/basic-html-website)

[Roadmap.sh-portfolio-website](https://roadmap.sh/projects/portfolio-website)

Will later integrate a live website, so you don't have to remotely open it locally.
